## Cloudinary SDK usage and integration with Next JS 14

The goal of this repo is to play around using [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/)  SDK with Next JS 14. Asides, it is good to have a brief walkthrough on Next JS concepts implementation details such as Client side and Server side components along with server actions. 

### What is here for fun part
Cloudinary provides AI image manipulation service alonside other services. We have tried to somehow use some services such as **Image background removal**, **Image refill**, **Image re-creation** etc. 

### Tools used
Below tech stack is being used to accomplish this tiny hands-on;

1. [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/products/platform/atlas-database) - Data storage 
2. [**Clerk**](https://clerk.com) - Authentication and user management
3. [**Cloudirany**](https://cloudinary.com/) - AI powered image manipulation
4. [**Stipe**](https://stripe.com/en-fr) - Payment integration

And for sure [Next JS 14](https://nextjs.org/) with [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

You can give it a quick look [here](https://cloudinary-demo-eta.vercel.app/).
